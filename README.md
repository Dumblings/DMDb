### Translating

**THIS FEATURE IS COMING SOON**

Translating is the easiest and most beneficial way to contribute to DMDb. Add or improve
translations for different languages and enhance the experience for other users.

DMDb is primarily looking for translations for the following langauges: `German (de), French (fr),
Spanish (es), Russian (ru), Italian (it), Portuguese (pt), Chinese Simplified (zh) and Korean (ko).`
These are the popular contributed languages on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/contribute).

Translations can be found in the `/lang` directory, stored in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) and
named as the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code of the language. If the
language you want to translate doesn't already exist, use the `en.json` file as a template as it's
the default and most up to date. If the language is already translated, compare it to the `en.json`
file and add or improve any values.
